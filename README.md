# 🎵 Spotify Clone - Web Music Player

Hi! This is a **Spotify-inspired music streaming UI** I built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It's a fully responsive front-end project that mimics Spotify's core layout, includes a functioning audio player, and lets you browse and play songs.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎧 Play, pause, skip, and seek songs  
- 🎚️ Volume control + mute/unmute  
- 🖼️ Dynamic album display (loaded from folders)  
- 📱 Fully responsive layout with a collapsible sidebar  
- 🧠 Keyboard controls (e.g., spacebar to toggle play/pause)  
- 💅 Clean, modern UI with custom styling

## 🛠️ Tech Stack I Used

- **HTML5** – Markup and layout  
- **CSS3** – Styling and responsiveness  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Interactivity, DOM manipulation  
- **Audio API** – For playing songs
